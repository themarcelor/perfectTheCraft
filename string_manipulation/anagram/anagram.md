# Anagram

We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.

# Input


The first line contains a single string, a. 
The second line contains a single string, b.


# Output

Print a single integer denoting the number of characters you must delete to make the two strings anagrams of each other.
